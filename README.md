<h2><a class="anchor" id="overview"></a>Executive Summary</h2>
This​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌ project uses an interactive Power BI dashboard to assess the revenue and occupancy performance of a hospitality business. The study is mainly concentrated on business metrics such as revenue generated, revenue realized, occupancy rate, ADR, RevPAR, And Customer ratings.
The main goal of this project is to provide the revenue management teams with the right hand of the management in the form of the decision-making process.
Most of the findings show upward trends of occupancy, good pricing performance, and a significant contribution of premium room categories. Nevertheless, the dependency on OTA platforms and lower ratings in certain room classes may lead to the profitability of the business being risked.
The recommendations derived from the insights are pricing strategy optimization during high-demand periods, the focus on direct bookings and service quality improvement to increase customer satisfaction and revenue ‌ ​‍​‌‍​‍‌​‍​‌‍​‍‌sustainability.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="business-problem"></a>Business Problem</h2>
AtliQ Grands, an established five-star hotel chain in India, is currently losing market share and revenue, particularly within the **Luxury/Business hotels category**. This decline is attributed to strategic moves by competitors and internal ineffective decision-making. To counter this, the managing director is initiating a strategic move to incorporate **Business and Data Intelligence** to regain market position. Since AtliQ Grands lacks an in-house data analytics team, they have hired a third-party service provider to provide data-driven insights. The core objective is to analyze historical data and create a dashboard and insights that specifically compare performance across the Luxury and Business segments to guide the revenue team's recovery strategy.
